While sentiment is positive on the demand side, supply side factors such as stable land prices and high construction costs indicate that new home prices will likely remain firm. Developer participation in land tenders has been significantly lower in the past 2 years (averaging 2 to 3 bidders compared to a historical average of 10), suggesting caution in the market. Given that overall tender prices have remained relatively stable, along with persistently high construction costs, we foresee limited potential for a decrease in new home launch prices.
For HDB resale market, the DBS Research team anticipates prices will be supported by: (i) permanent residents (PRs) and (ii) former private homeowners who have completed the 15-month wait-out period after selling their private homes. These buyers, potentially with substantial gains from the sale of their private property, could provide more momentum for HDB prices to rise in 2025.

Upgraders represent a significant segment of the private home market. They typically leverage the proceeds from selling their HDB flats and accumulated savings for downpayments. A large pool of potential upgraders is expected, with over 100,000 HDB flats reaching their Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) between 2019 and 2023. Furthermore, rising household incomes, with a growing number exceeding S$20,000 per month, suggest an increased capacity to afford private properties, supporting continued demand.

The DBS Research team projects a year-on-year increase in new home sales volume, driven by a strong pipeline of upcoming launches and attractive buyer interest. Prime Government Land Sales (GLS) sites in desirable locations (Orchard Boulevard, Zion Road, Holland Drive, and River Valley Green) are expected to attract significant attention, particularly if competitively priced.
Property outlook 2025 - Are home prices stabilising?
The anticipated launch of 3 Executive Condominiums (ECs) in 2025, Aurelle of Tampines (Q12025), Plantation Close (Q22025) and Jalan Loyang Besar (Q42025), typically experiencing strong sales due to affordability, will further contribute to this growth. Overall, declining interest rates are expected to support robust transaction volumes in the new launch market in 2025.

While interest rates and macroeconomic shifts tend to dominate headlines, one of the most grounded indicators of property market resilience is still the classic balance of supply and demand — and in Singapore, that balance continues to point toward strength and stability in the years ahead.
Between 2025 and 2027, the supply of newly completed private residential units is expected to fall significantly below the 10-year average of 12,000 units per year. Current projections estimate about 5,300 units in 2025, 7,600 in 2026, and 11,000 in 2027. With fewer new units entering the market, competition for available homes is likely to remain strong, especially in established and high-demand areas.
On the demand side, we continue to see a steady flow of HDB owners reaching their Minimum Occupation Period (MOP), many of whom are ready to take the next step in their property journey. Backed by CPF savings and built-up equity from their first home, these upgraders form a consistent demand base for both new launches and resale condominiums.

14   There has been a progressive ramp up in the overall private housing supply through the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme in recent years. For 1H2025, the supply has been raised to 8,505 units, with 5,030 units to be tendered out via the GLS Confirmed List. This is almost 60% higher than the average Confirmed List supply from 2021 to 2023.
15   Close to 1,000 EC units (3 sites) were launched under the GLS Confirmed List in 1H2025 and a further 1,000 EC units (2 sites) will be launched in 2H2025. This brings the total EC supply to 2,000 units (5 sites) for the whole of 2025 – the highest EC supply in recent years, almost double the average yearly supply launched from 2021 to 2023.

As we navigate through a period of global economic uncertainty, it’s natural for buyers and investors to feel cautious. Headlines may be filled with concerns over recession risks, trade tensions, and shifting interest rates. Yet, amidst the noise, Singapore’s property market continues to offer clarity, resilience, and long-term value.
No one can predict the future with absolute certainty. But when we look at the facts, history, and the safeguards in place, there’s plenty of reason to take heart and remain calmly confident in Singapore real estate as a stable, long-term asset.
Here’s why:

source_url: https://darrenong.sg/blog/is-it-still-safe-to-enter-the-property-market-in-2025-amid-u-s-tariffs/
filename: darrenong.sg/blog/is-it-still-safe-to-enter-the-property-market-in-2025-amid-u-s-tariffs/

In this environment, buyers — especially those on floating-rate mortgage packages — should be prepared for interest rate fluctuations and consider reviewing their loan terms or refinancing strategies where appropriate.
At the same time, the volatile stock market environment is prompting many investors to reconsider where they park their capital. As risk appetite shifts, real estate is once again being seen as a more stable and tangible investment that offers both long-term capital appreciation and steady rental yields.
Interest Rates Vs Property Market Trend
Historically, Singapore’s property market has responded positively to such conditions. Property prices have appreciated four out of five times after interest rates peaked and began to fall. A low interest rate environment tends to revive buyer interest, particularly among seasoned investors seeking predictable returns.
If this cycle plays out similarly, we may see renewed activity from both local and foreign investors, especially in sought-after areas with limited new supply — reinforcing the resilience of the market through yet another wave of global uncertainty.
