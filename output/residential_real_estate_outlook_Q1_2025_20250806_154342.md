The remaining 13 recessions were considered mild to moderate, and in 8 of those instances, property prices in Singapore continued to hold or rise. That’s a 61.5% probability that real estate values remained resilient despite economic slowdowns.
This tells us that not all recessions are created equal—and not all will cause property prices to fall. The severity and underlying cause of a recession matter. In periods of manageable downturns—such as the dot-com bubble, trade slowdowns, or health-related events like SARS—Singapore’s property market has shown its strength, underpinned by local demand, sound fundamentals, and timely government intervention.

## Macroeconomic Trends

• Against the backdrop of slowing global and regional trade as well as heightened economic policy uncertainty, Singapore’s GDP growth for 2025 is expected to slow to 0.0–2.0%, down from 4.4% last year. While domestic interest rates have eased from its peak at end-2023, they are expected to remain higher than the low levels seen over the past decade. Given the evolving landscape and interest rate environment, households are advised to exercise financial prudence in their property purchases and borrowing.

Prices and Rentals
Prices of private residential properties increased by 0.8% in 1st Quarter 2025, compared with the 2.3% increase in the previous quarter.

Upgraders represent a significant segment of the private home market. They typically leverage the proceeds from selling their HDB flats and accumulated savings for downpayments. A large pool of potential upgraders is expected, with over 100,000 HDB flats reaching their Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) between 2019 and 2023. Furthermore, rising household incomes, with a growing number exceeding S$20,000 per month, suggest an increased capacity to afford private properties, supporting continued demand.

## Sales Market

While interest rates and macroeconomic shifts tend to dominate headlines, one of the most grounded indicators of property market resilience is still the classic balance of supply and demand — and in Singapore, that balance continues to point toward strength and stability in the years ahead.
Between 2025 and 2027, the supply of newly completed private residential units is expected to fall significantly below the 10-year average of 12,000 units per year. Current projections estimate about 5,300 units in 2025, 7,600 in 2026, and 11,000 in 2027. With fewer new units entering the market, competition for available homes is likely to remain strong, especially in established and high-demand areas.
On the demand side, we continue to see a steady flow of HDB owners reaching their Minimum Occupation Period (MOP), many of whom are ready to take the next step in their property journey. Backed by CPF savings and built-up equity from their first home, these upgraders form a consistent demand base for both new launches and resale condominiums.


The DBS Research team projects a year-on-year increase in new home sales volume, driven by a strong pipeline of upcoming launches and attractive buyer interest. Prime Government Land Sales (GLS) sites in desirable locations (Orchard Boulevard, Zion Road, Holland Drive, and River Valley Green) are expected to attract significant attention, particularly if competitively priced.
Property outlook 2025 - Are home prices stabilising?
The anticipated launch of 3 Executive Condominiums (ECs) in 2025, Aurelle of Tampines (Q12025), Plantation Close (Q22025) and Jalan Loyang Besar (Q42025), typically experiencing strong sales due to affordability, will further contribute to this growth. Overall, declining interest rates are expected to support robust transaction volumes in the new launch market in 2025.

Supply in the Pipeline


There has been a progressive ramp up in the overall private housing supply through the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme in recent years. For 1H2025, the supply has been raised to 8,505 units, with 5,030 units to be tendered out via the GLS Confirmed List. This is almost 60% higher than the average Confirmed List supply from 2021 to 2023.
Close to 1,000 EC units (3 sites) were launched under the GLS Confirmed List in 1H2025 and a further 1,000 EC units (2 sites) will be launched in 2H2025. This brings the total EC supply to 2,000 units (5 sites) for the whole of 2025 – the highest EC supply in recent years, almost double the average yearly supply launched from 2021 to 2023.

## Outlook

As we navigate through a period of global economic uncertainty, it’s natural for buyers and investors to feel cautious. Headlines may be filled with concerns over recession risks, trade tensions, and shifting interest rates. Yet, amidst the noise, Singapore’s property market continues to offer clarity, resilience, and long-term value.
No one can predict the future with absolute certainty. But when we look at the facts, history, and the safeguards in place, there’s plenty of reason to take heart and remain calmly confident in Singapore real estate as a stable, long-term asset.
Here’s why:


With renewed concerns about a possible recession in 2025, many homeowners and investors in Singapore may begin to ask the pressing question: Is it still safe to enter the property market?
Over the past few years, property prices have climbed steadily, buoyed by strong demand, limited supply, and a stable economic environment. But with global uncertainties piling up — from shifting interest rate policies to geopolitical tensions — it’s understandable that some might hesitate before making their next move.
The short answer? Yes — and here’s why. Backed by decades of historical data, sound economic fundamentals, and well-calibrated government policies, the Singapore property market continues to be a stable and resilient asset class. For buyers and investors with a long-term perspective, the current environment still offers opportunities — especially when approached with careful planning and clear objectives.
