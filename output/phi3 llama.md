## Overview Summary

To summarize the key highlights of the given overview table, the table lists the key figures for supply in the pipeline, as well as the expected year of completion for PRUs and ECs in each quarter of 2025. It also includes information on Developmend Control, One-Stop Developer's Portal, Planning, Propety Market, Media Room, Media RelaeSees, Speeches, Careerse, Be part of an excEPtional team!, and Hall Rooms.

## Macroeconomic Trends

Yes, the economic factors that affect the Singapore real estate market include household income, Home Buyer's Price Ceiling (HBPC), foreign investment, and stamp duty impacts. The median household income in Singapore has increased steadily since 2000 to reach S$149,659 in 2023, which has led to rising housing affordability and higher demand for property due to the government-imposed HBPC and foreign investments, subject to various restrictions. Despite these investments, foreign investors have been subject to various restrictions since 2014, which may impact housing affordability slightly but are not expected to significantly alter property prices in the long term. The government-imposed HBPC has been gradually increased since 2015 to control property prices, and foreign investments continue to contribute to stable and sustainable growth. Overall, macroeconomic factors will have a significant impact on the real estate market in Singapore over the next few years, but these factors are still expected to contribute to stable and sustainable growth, as evidenced by the government-imposed HBPC, Foreign Investment restrictions, and stamp duty impacts.

## Sales Market

As per the given material, the Singapore property market begins 2025 with renewed confidence after a period of reduced transaction volume. While prices continue their upward trend, affordability is nearing its peak, requiring sufficient income growth to sustain this momentum. To support demand for new homes, developers have implemented pricing strategies that prioritize affordability while offering additional features and upgrade options. As of Q1 2025, new home sales have increased significantly compared to the previous quarter, with developers adapting pricing strategies to catapult demand at higher prices. However, affordability remains a significant issue among potential buyers, and continued pressure for new homes can be expected as demand remains high due to the rise in prices.

## Sales Launches

According to Abroca's query "Absolutely No Prior Knowledge," this context provides a broad overview or general information about the current state of private housing projects in Singapore, including new project launches and absorption trends. The given context covers all developers across all levels of the property market, indicating that there is no prior knowledge or understanding of any specific project or developer for "Absolutely No Prior Knowledge."

## Prices

To address the concern raised in the question, the original answer provided by the expert Q&A system states that according to the real estate information system provided by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the overall private residential property supply remained steady at 55,600 sq m as of 1st Quarter 2025. However, there was a sharp decrease in the stock of office space, which decreased by 98,000 sq m as of the same period. This indicates that the market has continued to recover and is experiencing an increase in demand for office space, with the stock of office space declining. The sharp decrease in office space supply may lead to increased rentals and rental rates in the private market, with price trends increasing slightly.

## Leasing Markets

The Q&A system has two modes for refining existing answers: "rewrite" and "repeate". When in doubt, just repeat the original answer. The new context is also referred to as the "backdrop" or the "evolving landscape", which includes changes in economic policy uncertainty, slowing global and regional trade, and increased interest rates. While domestic interest rates have eased from their peak at end-2023, households are advised to exercise financial prudence in their property purchases. The real estate statistics for 1st Quarter 2025 show prices increasing by 0.8%, while landed properties increased by 0.4% and non-landed properties increased by 1.0%.

## Executive Condominiums

The given text material mentions that the Singapore economy is strong, proactive government measures have eased cooling measures and increased home prices, while local demand has continued to be genuine and steady. The article also highlights multiple cooling measures, such as ABSD, SSD, LTV limits, and TDSR, can be eased if needed, providing tools to support the market. The article provides several trends related to the Singapore economy, including declining interest rates are expected to support robust transaction volumes in the new launch market in 2025.

## Outlook

Yes, the Q&A system used in this piece operates in two modes - rewrite and repeat. When a new context is not useful for providing additional information or answering previous questions, the system will refer to the original answer as a reference or simply repeat it. This ensures that users can focus on providing valuable insights into the current state of the property market in 2025 based on the new context. The rewritten/replaced answers are always based on the updated context and provide valuable insight into the current state of the market.
