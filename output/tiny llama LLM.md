## Overview Table

You are a Q&A system that strictly operates in two modes when refining existing answers:

1. **Repeating** the original answer using the new context.

Example: If the original answer was "What is the new context and what do I need to reference in my answer?" and you're asked for the Price Index, Renal Index, Take-up, Pipeline Supply, and Vacancy Ratate for Real Estate Market in Singapore, 2021-2025.

Replacement: When the original context isn't useful, refer back to the previous quarter for landed properties (1st Quarter 2025) and use the Renal Index of private residential properties (Real Estate Market in Singapore).

For reference, you can use the table below, which includes Price Index, Renal Index, Take-up, Pipeline Supply, and Vacancy Rate for Real Estate Market in Singapore:

If you've only got a minute:

- Executive Condominiums (ECs) are significantly more expensive than Prime/Plus BTO flatsthat impact their affordability, lifestyle preference, eligiabilty and long-term plans. The newer Prime/Plus BTO flats come with resale implicaitionsof clawbacks, andresale restrictions must be factored into the long-term planning.

Based on these new findings, the new government's amendments to the Resale Improvement Scheme (RIS) will likely have a limited impact on the affordability of Prime and higher price ranges, according to Daiwa Singapore. In an interview with Business Times, CEO Tan Chye Min said: "The RIS scheme is designed for people who are looking to buy high-end properties at an average of S$400 per sq ft (psf), but the new amendments do not apply to those purchasing such properties." He added that the new amendment may affect a limited number of flats in prime and higher price ranges, as well as executive condominiums.

On the other hand, a senior analyst at DBS Research said, "The amended RIS will likely have an impact on the affordability of lower-priceed BTO flats, given that developers are already increasing their down payment requirements to maintain the affordable price points." He added that it's too early to know whether this will lead to a shift towards smaller homes.

The Singapore property market is experiencing renewed confidence with renewed concerns over the impact of government subsidies and clawbacks on household income, house prices, and affordability. The new Prime/Plus BTO flat price ceiling will increase their affordability while ECs remain in high demand due to a shortage of supply, but a shift towards smaller homes could occur as developers continue to increase their down payment requirements to maintain the affordable price points.

## Sales Market

Sure, here's a revised response that includes insight and comparison of new home and resale market sales for 2025 based on The Business Times report.

Supply Completion (new units) & Supply in the Pipe Line (resale/sub-sale transactions):
According to the report, there were 1,988 private residential units (incuding ECs) completed in 2025 (See Annex E-4). This suggests a total supply of 3,766 units for sale and 3,864 units for sale as at the end of January 2025.
Supply in the Pipe Line:
In 1st Quarter 2025, there were more than 90,000 housing demand share units between monthly mortgage repayments, indicating a significant pool of potential upgraders who could contribute positively to future resale sales.
According to URA and property portal ERA's real estate statistics, the market is expected to experience increased demand in 2025 with developers, builder, and investors better equipped to anticipate and plan for any potential downward trends or changes in supply availability due to accurate understanding of market demand.
New household formation: Based on SingStat data, an average of 20,000 new households have been formed annualy over the past five years, indicating a strong desire for homeownership in Singapore. This suggests sustainable housing demand in the coming year(s).

## Sales Launches

The given material states that there was a decrease in the State of New Project Launches in Q1 2025 compared to the previous quarter. Additionally, there were fewer total resale transactions compared to the previous quarter. This indicates that Singapore's property market continues to face competition, with lower demand for new projects compared to the previous quarter. The State of New Project Launches and Absorpition Transactions indicate a continuation of declining activity in new project launches and absorption trends.

## Prices

While the given text discusses property price trends in Singapore, there are no specific references to any real estate statistics provided by REALIS. Therefore, the new context provided above does not directly impact or relate to the answer provided in the given text. The given text provides a summary and analysis of real estate statistics from REALIS, which are used to track private and public sector residential properties in Singapore over time.

## Leasing Markets

The Q&A system uses two modes for refining existing answers, rewriting and repeating, based on the given information. In this case, "Repeat" refers to using an original answer as a reference point to produce a new or similar response if the original text is not useful. For example, when facing a slowing global trade trend and heightened economic policy uncertainty, Singapore's GDP growth for 2025 is expected to slow down to 0.0â€“2.0%, but domestic interest rates have already reduced from their peak at the end of the past decade. Given these evolving market conditions, households are advised to exercise financial prudence in their property purchases and borrowing.

## Executive Condominiums

To address the given text material, please provide a new answer that reflects the new context and potential impact of trade tensions on Singapore's open and externally oriented economy. In terms of the EC market - demand, pricing, and government policies - the new answer should highlight how the government may ease affordability issues through measures such as ABSD and SSDR, but these measures may face challenges in the near term due to economic uncertainty. Regarding overall trends, the text mentions a growing sense of uncertainty around the outlook for demand dynamics in the coming months, which could have both positive and negative impacts on the overall trends over time.

## Outlook

Re-Written: DarrenoNGS's blog "Is it still safe to enter the property market in 2025? Revisited" features a comprehensive analysis of current trends and risks in Singapore's housing market. The author, DarrenoNGS, reviews recent events such as the impact of COVID-19 on property prices and the expected increase in interest rates. He also examines the supply and demand balance in the market and suggests strategies for homebuyers and investors who are seeking to enter or refinance properties. The article includes several instances where the original answer is repeated without any context, which can lead to erroneous results. By clarifying context and providing a new explanation, readers can better understand the author's analysis and make more informed decisions.
